# Dead Lead Reactivation Scripts
## 7 Proven Scripts to Wake Up Your Database

*Combining NEPQ (Jeremy Miner), Value-First (Alex Hormozi), and Reverse Selling (Brandon Mulrenin)*

---

## Why These Scripts Work

Most agents blast their old leads with desperate messages like:
- "Just checking in!"
- "Still looking to buy/sell?"
- "I have a great listing for you!"

These get ignored because they're **seller-focused** and **predictable**.

The scripts below use three psychological principles:

1. **NEPQ (Miner):** Ask questions that make THEM realize their own need
2. **Value-First (Hormozi):** Lead with something genuinely useful
3. **Reverse Selling (Mulrenin):** Take away the sale to create desire

## Script #1: The Database Cleanup
*Methodology: Brandon Mulrenin's Reverse Selling*

**The Psychology:** People fear loss more than they desire gain. By suggesting you're removing them, you trigger loss aversion and make them re-engage.

```
Hey {first_name}, I'm cleaning up my database and noticed we never connected after we first spoke.

Not sure if buying/selling is even on your radar anymore - totally fine if it's not.

Should I keep you on my list or go ahead and close out your file?
```

**Why it works:**
- Pattern interrupt (they expect you to CHASE, not remove)
- No pressure (disarms their defenses)
- Forces a response (they don't want to be "closed out")
- Qualifies them (serious people identify themselves)

**Typical responses:**
- "Actually, I'm still thinking about it..."
- "Yeah we're planning to do something next year"
- "Go ahead and remove me" (saves you time - they were never buying)

---

## Script #2: The Curiosity Question
*Methodology: Jeremy Miner's NEPQ*

**The Psychology:** Questions create engagement. This script gets them talking about their situation without feeling sold to.

```
Hey {first_name}, random question for you -

When we talked a while back, you mentioned wanting to {buy/sell/move}. Just curious, has anything changed with that, or is it still something you're thinking about?
```

**Why it works:**
- Opens with curiosity (non-threatening)
- References past conversation (shows you remember them)
- Neutral question (not pushing for a yes)
- "Still thinking about" acknowledges life happens

**Follow-up (when they say "still thinking"):**
```
Makes sense. What's been the main thing holding you back from moving forward?
```

This is pure NEPQ - you're making THEM articulate the problem.

---

## Script #3: The Valuable Intel
*Methodology: Alex Hormozi's Value-First*

**The Psychology:** Lead with something genuinely useful. No ask, just value. This builds reciprocity and positions you as the expert.

```
Hey {first_name}, thought of you -

Just saw {specific neighborhood/area} home values jumped 12% this quarter. A few homes near {their street/area} sold above asking in under a week.

Not sure if that changes anything for you, but figured you'd want to know.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specific data (not vague "market is hot")
- Personalized to their area (shows you did homework)
- No ask (pure value, no pressure)
- "Not sure if that changes anything" is Mulrenin's takeaway

**Variation for buyers:**
```
Hey {first_name}, quick heads up -

Interest rates just dipped to {X}% this week. For a {price range} home, that's about ${X}/month less than when we last talked.

Might not matter for your situation, but wanted to pass it along.
```

---

## Script #4: The Honest Question
*Methodology: Jeremy Miner's Problem-Awareness Questions*

**The Psychology:** This script gets them to verbalize what's been stopping them - and often, saying it out loud makes them realize it's not a real blocker.

```
Hey {first_name}, honest question -

When we first connected, you seemed pretty interested in {buying/selling}. What ended up happening with that?

No pressure either way, just curious.
```

**Why it works:**
- "Honest question" signals authenticity
- Asks what happened (not "are you still interested")
- "No pressure" disarms (Mulrenin)
- They often talk themselves back into it

**Common responses and follow-ups:**

*"We got busy with life"*
```
Totally get it. Has anything changed recently, or is the timing still not right?
```

*"We couldn't find anything we liked"*
```
That's frustrating. What were you looking for that you couldn't find?
```

*"The market was too crazy"*
```
Makes sense. What would the market need to look like for you to feel good about moving forward?
```

Each follow-up is a Miner-style problem-awareness question.

## Script #5: The "Found Something" Tease
*Methodology: Hormozi Value + Mulrenin Takeaway*

**The Psychology:** Specificity creates curiosity. But the takeaway ("might not be what you're looking for") prevents it from feeling salesy.

```
Hey {first_name}, this might be a long shot, but...

I came across a {property type} in {area} that reminded me of what you were looking for. {One specific detail - "big backyard", "under $X", "quiet street"}.

Probably not what you're looking for anymore, but figured I'd mention it just in case.
```

**Why it works:**
- "Long shot" and "probably not" = reverse selling
- Specific detail proves you remember their criteria
- Creates FOMO (what if it IS perfect?)
- Low pressure response

**For sellers:**
```
Hey {first_name}, random thought -

I just helped a client sell in {their neighborhood} for {impressive number/detail}. Made me think of your place.

Not sure if selling is even on your mind right now, but if you're curious what yours might go for, I'm happy to run the numbers.
```

## Script #6: The Permission Close
*Methodology: All Three Combined*

**The Psychology:** This is for warmer leads who've shown some interest. It combines Miner's commitment questions, Hormozi's specificity, and Mulrenin's takeaway.

```
Hey {first_name}, I know we've been talking on and off for a while.

I don't want to keep bothering you if the timing isn't right. At the same time, I don't want you to miss out if it is.

Real quick - on a scale of 1-10, how serious are you about {buying/selling} in the next 6 months?
```

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges the long timeline (validates them)
- "Don't want to keep bothering you" = permission to leave (Mulrenin)
- "Don't want you to miss out" = subtle FOMO (Hormozi)
- Scale question = commitment question (Miner)

**Follow-up based on their number:**

*1-3:* "Got it, no worries. I'll check back in a few months. Anything change, you know where to find me."

*4-6:* "Makes sense. What would need to happen to move that to a 7 or 8?"

*7-10:* "Love it. What's been stopping us from getting started?"

## Script #7: The Straight Shooter
*Methodology: Brandon Mulrenin's Radical Honesty*

**The Psychology:** Sometimes brutal honesty is the ultimate pattern interrupt. This works especially well when you've followed up multiple times with no response.

```
Hey {first_name}, I'm just gonna be real with you.

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back. Totally fine if you're not interested - I'd rather know so I'm not bugging you.

Are you still thinking about {buying/selling}, or should I stop reaching out?
```

**Why it works:**
- Radical honesty (unexpected from a salesperson)
- Gives them permission to say no (reduces pressure)
- Binary choice forces a decision
- Respectful of their time

**The magic:** Most people feel guilty and respond. Even if they say "stop reaching out," you've cleaned your database. If they say "still thinking," you've restarted the conversation.

## How to Use These Scripts

### For SMS Campaigns:
1. Pick 2-3 scripts that match your lead type
2. Personalize the {variables}
3. Send in waves (don't blast everyone at once)
4. Let your AI agent handle the responses

### For Manual Follow-Up:
1. Use Script #1 or #7 for cold/unresponsive leads
2. Use Script #3 or #5 for leads who engaged but went quiet
3. Use Script #6 for warm leads you want to close

### Response Handling:
When they reply, switch to **Miner's NEPQ framework:**
1. Acknowledge what they said
2. Ask a follow-up question about their situation
3. Let THEM talk themselves into the next step
4. Only pitch when they've verbalized the problem AND the desire to solve it

---

## The Follow-Up Framework

No matter which script gets a response, use this sequence:

**Step 1: Acknowledge + Question**
> "That makes sense. What's been the main thing holding you back?"

**Step 2: Go Deeper**
> "And what happens if that doesn't change in the next 6-12 months?"

**Step 3: Solution Awareness**
> "If we could figure out a way to {solve their stated problem}, would that change things?"

**Step 4: Soft Close**
> "Want to hop on a quick call and see if it makes sense to move forward?"
