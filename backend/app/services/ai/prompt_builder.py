"""Voice prompt builder for consistent prompt engineering.

This module consolidates all prompt construction logic that was previously
duplicated across voice agent implementations. It provides a single source
of truth for:
- Date context injection
- Identity prefix
- Realism cues (Grok)
- Search guidance
- Telephony guidance
- Booking instructions

Usage:
    builder = VoicePromptBuilder(agent, timezone="America/New_York")
    prompt = builder.build_full_prompt(
        base_prompt=agent.system_prompt,
        include_realism=True,

   - Example: "Entering extension. <dtmf>123</dtmf>"
4. WAIT SILENTLY after sending - don't speak until human responds
5. If menu repeats, try a DIFFERENT numbered option (1-9) you haven't tried yet

Format: <dtmf>X</dtmf> where X is digit(s) (0-9, *, #)

[APPOINTMENT BOOKING - CRITICAL DATE AND RULES]
TODAY IS {today_str} ({today_iso}).
Your training data may be outdated - IGNORE IT. The ACTUAL current date is {today_iso}.

When converting relative dates to YYYY-MM-DD format:
- "today" = {today_iso}
- "tomorrow" = the day after {today_iso}
- "Friday" = the NEXT Friday from {today_iso} (calculate it)
- "next week" = the week starting after {today_iso}
- "Monday" = the NEXT Monday from {today_iso}

You have tools to check calendar availability and book appointments. Follow these rules:

1. NEVER say "one moment", "let me check", "checking", or "I'll get back to you"
2. NEVER promise to do something without IMMEDIATELY calling the function
3. When the customer asks about times, call check_availability RIGHT NOW
4. When the customer picks a time, call book_appointment RIGHT NOW
5. EMAIL IS REQUIRED for booking - ask for it when offering time slots

WHEN TO CALL check_availability:
- Customer asks about availability ("when are you free", "what times work")
- Customer mentions a day ("Monday", "tomorrow", "next week", "Friday")
- Customer wants to schedule or book something
- ALWAYS use dates relative to {today_iso}, NOT your training data dates

WHEN TO CALL book_appointment:
- Customer confirms a specific time AND you have their email

RESPONSE PATTERN:
- If they ask about times: Call check_availability, then offer 2 specific options
- If they pick a time and you have email: Call book_appointment immediately
- If they pick a time but no email: Ask for email, then book once provided

DO NOT say things like "I'll check and get back to you" - you can check instantly!

TIME FORMAT RULES:
- ALWAYS speak times in 12-hour AM/PM format (e.g., "2 PM", "10:30 AM")
- NEVER say times in military/24-hour format (do NOT say "fourteen hundred" or "1500")
- The tool results include display_time in 12-hour format - use those when speaking
- The book_appointment tool still accepts HH:MM 24-hour format for the time parameter

AVAILABILITY ACCURACY RULES:
- ONLY offer times from check_availability. NEVER make up or guess times.
- If booking fails, use alternative_slots from the error. Do NOT re-state failed time.
- When booking fails, say "That time is no longer available" and offer alternatives.
- If no alternatives are provided, ask the customer to check a different day.
- NEVER offer a time that was not explicitly returned by a tool."""
