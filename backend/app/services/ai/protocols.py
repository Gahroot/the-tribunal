"""Voice agent protocol definitions.

This module defines the formal interfaces that all voice agent implementations
must follow, using Python's Protocol for structural subtyping.

Protocols:
    VoiceAgentProtocol: Core voice agent interface for connection and audio streaming
    ToolCallableProtocol: Interface for agents that support tool/function calling
    InterruptibleProtocol: Interface for agents that support barge-in handling
